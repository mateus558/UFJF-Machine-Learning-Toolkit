================================
UFJF - Machine Learning Toolkit
================================

UFJF-MLTK is a cross-platform framework written in the C++ language for the development and 
usage of machine learning algorithms, addresses several types of learning problems such as classification, regression, 
clustering, feature selection, and ensemble learning. It aims to provide an always growing 
set of algorithms and tools for machine learning researchers and enthusiasts in its projects.
